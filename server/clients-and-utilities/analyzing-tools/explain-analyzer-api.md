# EXPLAIN Analyzer API

{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;`EXPLAIN` Analyzer is no longer active.
{% endhint %}

The online `EXPLAIN` Analyzer tool has an open API to allow client applications to send it EXPLAINs.

### Sending EXPLAINs to the EXPLAIN Analyzer

To send an `EXPLAIN` to the `EXPLAIN` Analyzer, simply `POST` or `GET` to the following address:

```bash
mariadb.org/explain_analyzer/api/1/?raw_explain=EXPLAIN&client=CLIENT
```

Replace "EXPLAIN" with the output of the EXPLAIN command and "CLIENT" with the name of your client.

### Client Banner

If you like, you can have a banner promoting your client appear at the bottom of the page. Once you've added support for the `EXPLAIN` Analyzer to your client application, just send a logo, the name of your client, and what you want the name and logo to link to to bryan AT montyprogram DOT com.
